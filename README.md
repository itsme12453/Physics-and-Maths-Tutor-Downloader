# Physics-and-Maths-Tutor-Downloader
This *simple* script allows you to download every file from Physics and Math Tutor... documentation is in progress....

Simply run main.js (Node.js) and it will download EVERY SINGLE FILE from Physics and maths Tutor
  Every SUBJECT
  Every SPECIFICATION
  Every EXAM QUESTION
  Every NOTES PDF
  ALL OF IT

Don't worry though, I am currently working on a documentation which will allow you to download only the specific subject/specification you want, giving you full customisability.


Do whatever you want with the script, I am not responsible... but I would appreciate it if you mentioned this repo if you use it :)
